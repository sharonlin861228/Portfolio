## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your deployment, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities from outdated packages.
- **Environment Variables:** Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to secure communications.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
